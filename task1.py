Ask the user to enter a number. 
Tell them if the number is within Earth or Mars orbits
(2 points)

Inputs:
a number (float)

Outputs:
That is within normal Earth or Mars orbit.
That is not within normal Earth or Mars orbit.


Example:
Enter the distance from the sun in AU: 9.4
That is not within normal Earth or Mars orbit.

Enter the distance from the sun in AU: 1.011
That is within normal Earth or Mars orbit.

Enter the distance from the sun in AU: 1.6
That is within normal Earth or Mars orbit.

Enter the distance from the sun in AU: 2
That is not within normal Earth or Mars orbit.
